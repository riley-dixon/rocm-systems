# Tests the jq logic that derives full_CI_images_matrix from ci_matrix in
# .github/workflows/hipfile-ci-toplevel.yml (Precheck job -> "Compute matrix
# configurations" step). That logic simulates GHA's matrix expansion
# (cross-product -> exclude -> include with merge semantics), projects each
# resulting combo down to (supported_platforms, rocm_versions), and dedupes.
#
# The function `project_image_matrix` below is a verbatim copy of the
# workflow's jq pipeline. If you edit the workflow's jq, mirror the change
# here and re-run. Conversely, if a test scenario surprises you, fix the
# workflow accordingly.

# Usage: bash projects/hipfile/util/test-full-ci-images-matrix.sh
